# Security_Tools
## Developed by AnÄ±l Emre DURAK

### Overview
Security_Tools is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed for both system and web application penetration testing (pentesting) and network monitoring. The primary goal of this project is to provide a set of tools that aid in identifying vulnerabilities in various environments and monitoring network traffic to enhance security measures.

### Features
- **System Penetration Testing**: Automated and manual tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems and local environments.
- **Web Application Penetration Testing**: Tools for discovering and exploiting web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **Network Monitoring**: Real-time network monitoring tools designed to capture, analyze, and report on network traffic, helping to identify potential threats or performance issues.

### Tools Included
1. **System Vulnerability Scanner**: A Python-based script that scans local systems for common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
2. **Web Application Vulnerability Scanner**: Tools to test common web security vulnerabilities.
3. **SQL Injection Exploit Tool**: A module to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Tester**: A script designed to test for XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.
5. **Network Traffic Analyzer**: A tool to capture and analyze network packets for suspicious activity or abnormal patterns.

### Future Plans
- Integration with cloud services for pentesting distributed systems.
- Expanding the network monitoring toolset to include anomaly detection using machine learning.
- Adding reporting features for generating comprehensive pentest and monitoring reports.
